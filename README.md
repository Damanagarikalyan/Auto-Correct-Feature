In this project, we’ll create an autocorrection generator using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our goal is to suggest the correct spellings for input words. We’ll use Python for implementation, leveraging the NLTK library for NLP-related tasks.

Project Steps:
Word List Creation:
We’ll start by importing a text file containing a list of correct words. This file will serve as our vocabulary.
The NLTK library will help us tokenize and extract words from the text file.

Word Frequency Count:
Next, we’ll count the frequency of each word in the entire text file.
We’ll create a dictionary to store word frequencies.

Probability Calculation:
To calculate the probability of each word, we’ll divide its frequency by the total word count.
This step helps us estimate the likelihood of encountering a specific word.

Word Correction Strategies:
Our autocorrector will employ several strategies to suggest corrections:
Lemmatization: Extracting root words (lemmas) using the NLTK library.
Deletion of Letters: Removing a letter from a given word.
Switching Letters: Swapping two letters within a word.
Letter Replacement: Replacing a letter with another.
Putting It All Together:
By combining these strategies, we’ll generate autocorrect suggestions for misspelled words.
